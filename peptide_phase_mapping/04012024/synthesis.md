## Preparation of stock solutions for peptide-Au synthesis.

We use following components in our synthesis : HAuCl4 (10 mM), HEPES (6 mM), peptides (0.3 mM).

The way to obtain relevant masses to weigh for preparing stock solutions is : `mass_required = concentration x volume x molecular weight`.

We ended up with the following : 
1. HEPES : 6mM -- mix 14.28 mg in 10 mL of water
2. Z2M246I : 0.3M -- mix 2.7 mg in 10 mL of water
3. Z2 : 0.3 mM -- mix 2.9 mg in 10 mL of water
4. HAuCl4 : 10 mM -- mix 100 ÂµL of 1M HAuCl4 in 9.9 ml of water 

For each one of these, we can also calculate the range of concentrations we would be sampling using `C1 x V1 = C2 x V2`
where `C1` is stock concentration and `V1` is the volume of stock we used in preprearing a sample in the well.
`C2` is the concentration we would obtain given the total volume in the well. 

Using the above, the minimum concentration is trivially 0 but the maximum concentration can be obtained by setting `V1` to be the maximum volume allowed in preparing any sample.
